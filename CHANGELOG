PyNDN v2.0alpha1 (2014-02-21)

This is the Python 2.0 initial release, with support for the NDN-TLV wire format in pure Python.

Support to be added soon:
* Security library support for verifying a data packet signature.
* Performance improvements for Python versions before 3.3.
* UDP transport.
* Right now, registerPrefix only works the first time it registers with ndnd-tlv. To get it 
  to work again, it is necessary to restart with ndnd-tlv-stop; ndnd-tlv-start and then it
  is possible to do registerPrefix again.  This will be fixed soon.
* Name utility methods like appendVersion.
* Name Python methods like __lt__.
* Package install support.
